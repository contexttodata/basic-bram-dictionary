# basic-bram-dictionary
a very basic dictory of bram describing things
in this i am aiming to slowely add more and more functionalty including command based questioning and a better database structure
curently to add new defination in the txt file you enter youre word folledby : then the description for example
apple:bram believes apples are a bitty underwelming fruit with poison seeds. and this is the line it will print
tho the plan is to remove the apple: and just display bram believes apples are a bitty underwelming fruit with poison seeds.
